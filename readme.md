# 🎨 Pattern Generator and Number Analyzer

A simple yet elegant Python program that combines pattern generation with number analysis capabilities. 
## ✨ Features

### 🔷 Pattern Generation
Generate beautiful star patterns with customizable rows. Watch as your pattern builds line by line!

### 🔢 Number Analysis
Analyze any range of numbers to discover:
- Whether each number is **odd** or **even**
- The **sum** of all numbers in the range

### 🎯 User-Friendly Interface
Clean menu-driven interface with easy navigation and input validation.

## 📖 Usage

When you run the program, you'll see a menu with three options:

### Option 1: Generate a Pattern
```
### Option 2: Analyze a Range of Numbers
```

### Option 3: Exit
Gracefully exits the program.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Code Structure
- **Menu System**: Interactive loop with match-case for option selection
- **Pattern Generation**: Nested loops for creating triangular star patterns
- **Number Analysis**: Range iteration with modulo operations for odd/even detection
- **Sum Calculation**: Accumulator pattern for calculating range totals

### Python Concepts Demonstrated
- `match-case` statements (Python 3.10+)
- Nested `for` loops
- String formatting and output control
- Conditional logic (`if-else`)
- User input handling
- Loop control (`break`)
